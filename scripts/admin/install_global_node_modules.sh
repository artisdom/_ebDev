# DESCRIPTION
# Installs all the nodejs (npm / node) modules I commonly use.

# USAGE
# Run without any parameters:
#    install_global_node_modules.sh
# NOTES
# To get a list of npm packages (without all their dependencies) and paste it into this list, run:
#    npm list -g --depth=0 > installedNPMpackages.txt


# CODE
packagesList=" \
ttab \
svgo \
buzzphrase \
csv-to-md \
markdown-styles \
gh \
afterwriting \
vanity-eth"

# Other potentially used packages:
# ungit

# NOTES
# - markdown-styles (I think!) changed name to generate-md and then back. What on earth, nodejs-land? Also, markdown-styles has many dependency and other warnings on install.
