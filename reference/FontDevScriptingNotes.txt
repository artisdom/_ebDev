===GENERAL===
If you use JUNCTIONS (per the below), whatever you set as the working path thusly, your scripts can refer to files in it without specifying the path (it will simply search there).

Most of those found from:

AUTOKERN:

had to manually download and install yaml:
http://pyyaml.org/download/pyyaml/PyYAML-3.10.win32-py2.6.exe
	-found via http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML

copy everything in /dependencies to pythonInstallDir/Lib/packages, and in each respective subfolder, run setup.py from the command line. If it gives an error, try setup.py build, then setup.py install.

===REDUCING ANNOYANCES===
JUNCTIONS: This can preclude the following annoyance; create a Junction link to whatever font manipulation directory you wish to use; name the junction link after your windows user name, and place it in the following folder:
C:\cygwin\home

It will insist on trying to open a file that was being edited upon close, even if that file does not exist. If so, clear a file named FontsOpenAtLastQuit in the Cygwin install dir, for example: C:\cygwin\home\ahall\.FontForge.
